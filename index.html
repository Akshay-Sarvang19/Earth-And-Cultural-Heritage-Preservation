<h3 id="ques1">Explanation about the Heritage of India</h3>
<ol><li>
<h3 id="ans1">Heritage is the full range of our inherited traditions, monuments, objects, and culture.<br>
     Most important, it is the range of contemporary activities, meanings, and behaviors that we draw from them.<br>
      Heritage includes, but is much more than preserving, excavating, displaying, or restoring a collection of old things.</h3>
<br></li>
<li><h3 id="ans1">The rich heritage of India, one of the world's oldest civilizations, is an all-embracing confluence of religions, traditions and customs. The highlights of Indian heritage lie in the treasure of its art, architecture, classical dance, music, flora and fauna, and the innate secular philosophy of its people.</li></h3>
<li><h3 id="ans1">India is considered the birthplace of some of the world's major religions: Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism and Sikhism. Today, other religions such as Muslim and Christianity have worked their way into the population as well, though Hinduism remains the most popular</h3></li>
<li><h3 id="ans1">Due to its adaptability and comprehensiveness, Indian culture has survived through the ages. Unity in diversity is one of the major characteristics of Indian culture which makes it unique. A synthesis of various cultures came about through the ages to give shape to what is recognised as Indian culture today.</li>
</h3></ol><br><br>
<h3 id="ques1">Why should we preserve the Heritage of India</h3>
<br>
<ol>
<li><h3 id="ans1">At a local level, heritage protection and conservation is not only a binding force within communities and groups but also a catalyst for economic development. Development of a heritage site leads to infrastructure development, opens up employment and enterprising opportunities and also provides exposure to local</h3></li>
<li><h3 id="ans1">It is important to preserve our cultural heritage, because it keeps our integrity as a people. The importance of intangible cultural heritage is not the cultural manifestation itself but rather the wealth of knowledge and skills that is transmitted through it from one generation to the next.
</h3></li>
<li><h3 id="ans1">As a source of identity, heritage is a valuable factor for empowering local communities and enabling vulnerable groups to participate fully in social and cultural life. It can also provide time-tested solutions for conflict prevention and reconciliation.
